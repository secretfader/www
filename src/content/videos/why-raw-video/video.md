The question isn't why you should use ProRes RAW, but instead, when. In 2024, many cameras support outputting a RAW signal (like my Sony FX3), the question is when you should use it in an artful manner.

In this short video, I compare clips from multiple shoots, each captured in XAVC S-I (Sony's H.264 intra-frame compressed internal codec) to ProRes RAW recorded externally from my Ninja Ultra. The results might surprise you.

Both are equally great codecs, but RAW wins out in difficult situations.
