My short documentary, Earth at Play, featuring Potter Anna Feldman, is available on YouTube now. I expected to drop it today but decided to stealthily release it late Friday evening for any curious followers. That only leaves one final Behind the Scenes film left to post. In this video, we are exploring Music, Lighting, and Post-Production; all of the items I couldn't reveal before the final production was completed.
