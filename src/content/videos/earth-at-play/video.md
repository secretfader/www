Pottery is permanent art. Don't think so? Ask all of the ancient civilizations, who left one primary artifact in their historical record: pottery. Small bits of shaped, fired, clay can tell us so much about our ancestors.

Today, I visit the studio of a friend; modern-day pottery artisan and educator, Anna Feldman. Anna's space is a small, dusty, room in Englewood, Colorado, where modern day artifacts are made.
