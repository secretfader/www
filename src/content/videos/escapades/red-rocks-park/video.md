Today, I want to let you in on a secret. I’m an outdoorsman, with a lifelong love of conservation; but as of 2020, I am also a double amputee. This has forced me to adapt how I play and work outside.

When I launched this channel, I decided to keep these details to myself. I was concerned, after all, that my disability would become the story, instead of simply a part of the greater narrative. I now realize that was never in the cards, and the story I have to tell is much more powerful if it is also authentic.

I hope you’ll join me on this adaptive outdoors series I am calling “Escapades.” We begin in my home state of Colorado, but who knows where we will end up.
