Rooted in Haitian folk and carefully crafted in Chicago, their melodies seem to have rejuvenating powers. They restore what peace once existed, and provide additional comfort to supplement it. Today on Inside the Machine, you'll meet [Medicine Bear and The Herbal Remedies](https://www.facebook.com/medicinebearandtheherbalremedies).

With songs influenced by events like Burning Man, their music invites deep contemplation &mdash; not only of the spirit within you, but of how we relate to the planet and environment. Music, they believe, is a method of healing our wounds, and has the power to restore unity between us and the world.
