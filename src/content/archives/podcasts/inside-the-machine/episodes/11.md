My guest this week is singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and Berkley College of Music alumnus [Munk Duane](http://munkduane.com). Over the last decade, he's built a reputation as a resilient, determined independent artist, by leveraging a diverse set of talents and artistic influences.

His records *Anime Sweetheart*, *Severed*, *Modest Among the Living*, and *Everywhere Is South of Somewhere* continue to grace my ears, even years after their release. His new musical project, *The Munk Duane Band* is poised to release their second effort *Argue With Gravity*.

In this hour-plus interview, we discuss his musical upbringing, songwriting inspiration, how to promote yourself (and your art), and much more.
