[Bobby Horton](http://bobbyhorton.com) is probably the most prolific artist we've hosted here. His career spans over 40 years, 12 albums, and countless projects. He is the undisputed authority on music from the American Civil War, and  a creative cohort to a diverse group of filmmakers including Ken Burns.

He has recorded ten volumes of period music from the Civil War; breathed new life into the music of America's first professional songwriter, Steven Foster; and occasionally, pens new melodies of his own.

Over his career, Bobby has performed solo, with his band *Three On a String*, and with symphonies around the world. He has scored films for The National Park Service and PBS, in addition to his critically acclaimed work with Burns and *Florentine Films*. Words alone cannot express the talent this man possesses.

He is a true music industry veteran, with many lessons to share. If you want to succeed as a musician, don't miss this interview.
