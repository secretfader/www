[Rob Funderburk](http://robfunderburk.com) is a graphic artist. [Josh Berman](http://joshberman.net) is a free-jazz cornetist. Together, they formed a [unique duo](http://www.tenxtenchicago.com/2015/08/ten-x-ten-2015-rob-funderburk-josh.html) for the 2015 installment of Homeroom Chicago's [Ten x Ten](http://www.tenxtenchicago.com).

What is Ten x Ten? If you're asking, don't feel alone: we'll break it down, piece by piece, in this comprehensive interview. In short, the project invites artists &mdash; one from the graphic arts and another from the musical realm &mdash; to meet and collaborate in real time. No, the musician isn't creating a piece inspired by original, pre-meditated artwork. The designer isn't reacting to a mixed, mastered piece of music. The artifacts &mdash; both music and print, created through this engagement &mdash; are envisioned, manufactured, and finalized at exactly the same time, under one roof.

The final result is an artistic marvel, one that we've been tasked with unraveling. Explore the mystery, magic, and limits of creativity itself with us. Press play.
