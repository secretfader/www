  Here in Chicago, our local music scene is anything but normal. It welcomes
  those who are bent on reckless experimentation; some aiming for greatness, and
  others for the total deconstruction of their art form. Today, though, I bring
  you a band from the former category: Spaces of Disappearance, a colorful (and
  relatively new) act that is, if possible, expanding what you'll recognize as
  electronica.

Here in Chicago, our local music scene is anything but normal. It welcomes those who are bent on reckless experimentation; some aiming for greatness, and others for the total deconstruction of their art form. Today, though, I bring you a band from the former category: [Spaces of Disappearance](http://spacesofdisappearance.com).

Founded amid the rubble of Elaine's previous band, Gag Order, Spaces of Disappearance has provided a home for the musical fragments that were otherwise out of place. Colorful rhythms, beefy synthesizers, and soaring vocals all find their place nestled amongst gritty fretless bass.

It's a one of a kind sound that you need to experience. My description cannot do it justice, so instead, I'll recommend this: press play to hear it now.
