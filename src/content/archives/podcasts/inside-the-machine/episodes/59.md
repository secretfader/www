Barely over five years ago, [Seryn](http://serynsound.com) was merely a dream. Starting an impromptu jam session, through a collection of serendipitous events, a band was born.

Their first record, *This Is Where We Are* was highly acclaimed by [Paste Magazine](http://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/seryn) and other prominent media outlets. Backing up this wonderful ink, the band launched an aggressive touring schedule, playing well over 100 dates during the first year, including the legendary [Telluride Bluegrass Festival](http://www.bluegrass.com/telluride).

Now, fresh off the release of their full-length follow up effort, *Shadow Shows*, Trenton Wheeler joins Nicholas Young to recount the band's history, tribulations, and lessons learned thus far.
