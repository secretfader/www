  In this week's episode, we meet another band that stumbled onto success, only
  to realize they couldn't, and didn't want to let go. From 90's pop into their
  now-popular Celtic/Folk sound, Carbon Leaf is a group that shouldn't stop...
  ever.

Sometimes, the best music happens by chance. Gather some of the finest musical improvisors, plant seeds of disenchantment with their boring day jobs, and sprinkle in a touch of ambition. This is the recipe for [Carbon Leaf](http://carbonleaf.com).

What began as an experimentation in early 90's pop (and all of the jangling guitars that come with it), has slowly morphed into a relaxing acoustic folk vibe, tinged with mild Celtic influence.

Long beloved in their hometown of Richmond and known for high-energy live shows, the group entered the national scene in 2002 after winning an American Music Award with their Irish-tinged hit “The Boxer,” a narrative about a fighter who's at the top of his game but scraping the bottom of love's barrel. Since then, they've recorded and released a staggering nine albums, including their latest release, *Indian Summer Revisited*, an enhanced reprise of their most successful album.

Today, your host is joined by Barry and Terry, the two pillars of this dynamite quintet out of Richmond, Virginia. Listen, and hear their story, from beginning to end, today on Inside the Machine.
