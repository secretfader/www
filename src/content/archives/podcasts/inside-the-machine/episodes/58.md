[Heather Bond](http://heatherbondmusic.com) has often been hailed as "Nashville's piano-pop starlet," but her work encompasses a vast array of musical styles &mdash; and cannot possibly be contained by a single definitive sentence. As an influential voice and contributor to several acts of the Music City's growing scene of independent artists, everyone we know holds her in very high regard. But to us, Heather to us is a valued friend and mainstay in our musical library.

Her 2009 EP *Walk Alone* was the first definitive work from a changing class of artists, as the one-time label dominated town found it's footing. And over the years, she has continued releasing honest tracks that tug at your heart; begging you to venture deeper.

Today we're proud to present two cuts from her debut full-length, *So Long*, and the story behind it. This album is the product of many restless nights, recording sessions, and demos lost to time. It is, to date, the masterwork of a growing artist who never backs down nor needs to justify her existence. It's brimming with confidence, and will mesmerize you for days.

Press play, and prepare yourself for a completely different musical experience.
