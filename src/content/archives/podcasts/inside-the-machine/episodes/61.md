Our guest today is a strong voice for positive change. [Kyshona Armstrong](http://kyshona.com) makes music that aims to improve the lives of her listeners, and ultimately, the world. Born in South Carolina, forged in the art capital of Athens, Georgia, and now living in Music City U.S.A., she is poised for a great 2015. Press play to experience the power of modern soul.

A few years later, she's back with a new passion: *Go*, her new full-length is a juggernaut - bowling over everyone who listens. Today on Inside the Machine, here a story of hardship, perseverance, and success.
