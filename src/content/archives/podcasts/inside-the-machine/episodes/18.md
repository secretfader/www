If asked to compile a list of intriguing people in my life, [Joshua Wentz](http://joshuawentz.com) would be near the top. He's a producer, screen printing genius, musician, and founder of _Sidedown Audio_, a boutique record label for home recording artists. His albums, _Look/Look_, _Golf Mike Oscar Victor Juliet_, and those of _Absinthe and the Dirty Floors_, a band he performed with, formed a major part of my personal soundtrack over the last few years.

In addition to his many talents above, he co-founded [_Dispatch_](/programs/dispatch/), a talk show focused on issues that affect modern creatives, with yours truly. (It airs here, on The Machine, Tuesdays at midnight GMT.)

We're co-hosts, friends, and creative collaborators &mdash; but we've rarely, if ever &mdash; discussed his life story. In this episode, he exposes older tracks from the back catalog, some of which have never been broadcast, and recounts his earliest experiences with music as an art form. Press play to experience this special edition of _Inside the Machine_.
