Put away your party-driven, late-night EDM: we're about to show you something different. In a world where electronic music is defined by who attracts the largest crowd of drunken revelers, the depth of a bass drop, or some other, vapid statistic &mdash;  our guests, Chicago duo [Dial In](http://dialinsound.com), stand apart.

Founded only a few years ago, Shane and Dan have already drafted a masterclass on songwriting structure and sonic depth. Examine their debut single and forthcoming EP, *Lost Frames*, and you'll realize each recording tells a story. Press play, and you'll be hooked.

In this hour and a half conversation, we're going deep. From the early days of their friendship at University of Illinois, their story is riddled with easily applicable lessons for aspiring musicians.
