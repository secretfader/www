Whether you're a chill-out music aficionado, casual radio listener, or champion of podcasting, you likely know [Anji Bee](http://anjibee.com). Her show, *[The Chillcast](http://anjibee.com)* is one of the longest running podcasts, serving up a weekly dose of the best electronica. In addition to the podcast version, the show is also syndicated to several terrestrial radio stations, and was once available on SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

For over a decade, her band, Lovespirals, has continually proven themselves as the foremost purveyor of Southern-California dream pop.

Even if you don't know Bee herself, you're likely familiar with her music. *Martha*, *The Oprah Winfrey Show*, and *MTV*, have all featured her work.

Her forthcoming full-length is expected later this year, as she turns yet another page in her storied career. I'm excited to host Anji here on Inside the Machine.
