Press play on your favorite album. Is the opening track what hooks you, or is it several tracks in? We all have our favorite moments &mdash; the riff beckoning us to listen closer, or a beat instructing our feet to move. But put on almost any track from [The Grooveblaster](http://thegrooveblaster.com), and you'll always find something to appreciate.

Hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina, his instrumentals are often paired with world class vocalists, including Anji Bee, Yasi Baby, and Jana Tarasenko.

His latest release, _Bop Dead City_, is an excursion into Philly Soul and Motown Funk, inviting the listener to chill. Press play to experience our hour-long interview with this talented creator.
