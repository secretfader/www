I've known [David Allie](http://davidallie.com) for several years, but this is our first conversation about his life and career. His lyrics are soaked in Detroit culture, and transform complex, important political statements into a listenable rhyme.

A political science graduate from U of Michigan, he is the personification of hip-hop culture, and it's concept of a well-informed self. From his home in Motor City, he has released 3 albums &mdash; each with a different flavor and collaboration style. I'm excited to speak with him, and I hope you're equally excited to listen.
