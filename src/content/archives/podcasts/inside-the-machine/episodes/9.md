Roughly a year ago, I had a unique opportunity. [Dustin Edge](http://dustinedge.com) was touring though Chicago, and wasn't sure when he would return. The Machine wasn't ready to launch, but we both knew he should be part of this network's programming.

On a Friday afternoon before his performance, we headed into the studio for a chat about his career, trips to the Czech Republic, teaching English, and his bright, hopeful future. I shelved the program, taking special care not to lose it, knowing we would air this discussion one day.

Since we recorded this, time has passed quickly, for both of us, but this interview is still fresh as when we first recorded it. Listen as Dustin tells his personal story, full of triumphs, frustrations, and experience you can learn from. He also was kind enough to give performances of three tracks from his discography, "Luminosity", "Weights and Measures", and "I Let It Lie".
