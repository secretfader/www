Once again, we shine the spotlight on another local act with tight melodies and infectious hooks: [The Kickback](http://thekickbackband.com).

Formed by Billy and Danny Yost in 2006, the band is still enjoying a steady rise towards the top. They tapped a fair amount of local success, but never quite found their ideal audience, which led the group to travel cross-country, where they eventually landed in Chicago.

Since 2009, they've toured their signature classics-inspired, reverb-drenched variant of rock, pursuading audiences nationwide that it's okay to dance at a rock show.

I was introduced to this band through their "greatest hits" EP, _Kill Fee_, a rollicking collection of tracks that, according to the band, don't quite belong together, but you'd never know. Their catalog is a masterclass on rock songwriting. Each track has it's "hook", but not one sounds stale or overthought. Next year, they're adding to the discography with _Sorry All Over The Place_, the band's long-awaited debut full-length.

I'm excited to have Billy Yost and Jonny Ifergan from The Kickback in the studio this week. Press play, and we'll all go Inside the Machine together.
