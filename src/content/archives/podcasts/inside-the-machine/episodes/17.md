These days, internet celebrities are commonplace. Often, they achieve this status through meritless tasks, and disappoint when you meet them in person.

This isn't the case with [Geoff Smith](http://thegeoffsmith.com). As a musician, producer, and founder of iPhone ringtone company [Ringtone Feeder](http://ringtonefeeder.com), Geoff rose to internet notoriety in the mid 2000's, contributing to the overall sound and production value of programs like Adam Curry's _Daily Source Code_.

Podcasting, as a platform, continued to grow in popularity, and Geoff has too. His album, _Ones and 0s_, was aimed squarely at fans of geek-rock. His follow-up, _That's Gravity_, continues to impress.

But I write all of this for you, not me. I've known Geoff personally for several years, having met him during my time in Nashville, Tennessee. I know him not as just an entertainer, but a friend. I'm proud to have him join me Inside the Machine.
