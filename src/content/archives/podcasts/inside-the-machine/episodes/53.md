  As many of you know, our studios are based in Chicago, Illinois. From the
  outside, many people see a city full of heartbreak and violence. Most
  residents see a metropolis full of art, beauty, and passion. While everyone,
  Chicagoan or not, acknowledges our failings, the reality is far too many
  people are hurt by the events in our locality. But how do we improve our
  situation? The four-piece a-cappella group, The Remedy, says music can be the
  healing balm on our wounds. We share their story today on Inside the Machine.

Four brothers, though not all of them are related by blood, form Chicago's freshest a-cappella group, [The Remedy](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Remedy/251030984908020). Their name is more than a moniker, it's a mission statement. Our city is broken, and needs healing. Music, they believe, is the vehicle to mend troubled hearts and lives.

It all began in 2003, when Jeremy met Durrell in high school. What began as casual vocal performances for friends would grow, over a decade of private practice and camaraderie, into the group you see today. The band has quickly made a name for themselves, appearing numerous times on local television, radio, and by competing in the 2014 season of *America's Got Talent*. Today, they join Nicholas in-studio to recount the story behind their work, and share aspirations for the future.
