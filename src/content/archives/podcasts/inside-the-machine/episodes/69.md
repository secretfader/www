  Drive down any Chicago street late at night, and you'll probably hear music
  coming from nearby alleyways. This is one of our city's many "garage" bands,
  practicing their riffs and preparing for bigger, better stages. Connoisseurs
  of this raw, unfettered style of music once branded it "garage rock", a genre
  that, regardless of what you think, is here to stay. Today on Inside the
  Machine, we present The Trolls, a powerful duo that will not bow to the gods
  of clean, polished pop.

Drive down any Chicago street late at night, and you'll probably hear music coming from nearby alleyways. This is one of our city's many "garage" bands, practicing their riffs and preparing for bigger, better stages. Connoisseurs of this raw, unfettered style of music once branded it "garage rock", a genre that, for better or worse, is here to stay.

In a city known for many musical innovations &mdash; house, funk, and soul all had their place here &mdash; Chicago's hearty attitude also gave birth to many other, far more rebellious acts. Today on Inside the Machine, we present [The Trolls](http://trollsongs.bandcamp.com) a powerful duo that will not bow to the gods of clean, polished pop.

Their debut record, *The Tenets of P.A.R.T.Y*, examines themes of self empowerment and mindfulness, but it also a reminder to let loose and just have fun. We turn the dial to eleven, and let it blast.
