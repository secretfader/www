For just a moment, let's be frank: most bands in the "fusion" genre sound rough at best. Country is infused with hip-hop, as is rock, while others attempt to mash jazz with different, often incompatible genres. Only select, extremely talented musicians can mix genres without a unlistenable degree of dissonance. Today, I introduce you to a band that handles this craft with grace and ease: [Marbin](http://marbinmusic.com).

Formed in 2009 by Israeli guitarist Dani Rabin and saxophonist Danny Markovitch, Marbin is on a mission to revitalize fusion music. Their collaboration began in a Tel Aviv living room, and quickly spilled over into the studio. Each were in different bands, and when a few of their comrades became ill before a studio session, they were the only ones left. In many ways, Marbin was formed by fate. 

Their three releases, "Marbin" (2009), "Breaking the Cycle" (2011), and "Last Chapter of Dreaming" (2013) represent not only the beginning of a new band, but the rebirth of an entire genre. In only a handful of releases, Marbin has redefined what jazz fusion listeners expect.

The band tours aggressively, performing over 250 dates each year. If you're anywhere in the United States, do not miss their explosive live show. But start here: press play to experience the magic.
