We're keeping it local with one of Chicago's most-lauded acts, [Strawberry Jacuzzi](https://www.facebook.com/StrawberryJacuzziBand). Founded by Nikita Word and Shannon Candy, both who have worked in a number of Windy City bands (Summer Girlfriends, The Peekaboos), they're out to &mdash; above all else &mdash; throw a great, rockin' party.

The band, and it's members, have grown a tremendous amount since their September 2014 debut, *Love is For Suckers*. Now, we look back on their history thus far, and forecast their future.

Nikita and Shannon were first introduced to listeners of The Machine when they joined Ashly for [Episode 1 of Chick Habit](/programs/chick-habit/1), and now, we present a different angle on their story. Tune in, rock out, and party hard!
