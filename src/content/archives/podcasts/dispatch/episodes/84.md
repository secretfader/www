  makes it difficult to be heard in a noisy world. Your hosts are joined today

[Bryan Bull](http://bullhornpublicity.com) is a publicist focusing on independent music, and the many projects that revolve around it. Hailing from Memphis, Tennessee, he's well-connected in the Nashville scene and has sent many artists to The Machine, including [Jars of Clay](https://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/inside-the-machine/34), [The Hawk In Paris](https://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/inside-the-machine/16), [Liza Anne](https://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/inside-the-machine/57), and [Jacob Thomas Jr.](https://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/inside-the-machine/47).

But we're not talking about those interviews today. Instead, we discuss what independent artists should be doing to promote their careers. Publicity can be a scary concept, but it's really the only safe bet for being heard in a noisy world. And having a pro, like Bryan, on your side might be worthwhile if you're looking to expose yourself to new audiences.

Specifically, we dive into how to act when contacting a publicist or media outlet, setting up your own Electronic Press Kit (EPK), and more.
