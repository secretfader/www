  It's the age old battle waged by every artist and business on the planet: is
  it better to be first to market, or can you succeed by simply improving on
  what came before? Does innovation for it's own sake benefit our customers, the
  planet, and our bottom line? We go deep into these questions this week on
  Dispatch.

It's the age old battle waged by every artist and business on the planet: is it better to be first to market, or can you succeed by simply improving on what came before? Does innovation for it's own sake benefit our customers, the planet, and our bottom line?

Regardless of whether you're a solo artist, green entrepreneur, or representing a well-funded venture-backed company, you have the responsibility to create responsibly. This means maximizing your output and accelerating forward progress, but you could also be chasing the notoriety of being first to bring an innovative product into the market. Is this honor worth chasing?

Along with our friends Danielle and Alex (who make several virtual contributions) we dive deep into this conversation, our eyes set on truth. Coming to you straight from our world-famous Chicago studios, this is Dispatch.
