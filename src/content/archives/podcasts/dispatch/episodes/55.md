What is your sacred space? Where do you create? Our guest, Billie Howard, has spent the last few years interviewing artists and photographing their studios or apartments. It's not about their influences, which many shows dive into, but rather the physical spaces where the work happens. Billie was previously featured on [Inside the Machine](https://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/inside-the-machine/44) with her band, [The Paver](http://www.thepaver.com), but this work stands alone.

It's where life happens. Where art happens. A space that helps you feel safe and creative. Recently, she's posted a revealing set of images with our friends [Lakshmi Ramgopal](http://bymeasure.blogspot.com/2014/07/lakshmi-ramgopal.html), [Coppice](http://bymeasure.blogspot.com/2013/01/coppice-noe-cuellar-joseph-kramer.html), and [many, many others](http://bymeasure.blogspot.com). Her series recently expanded to include a [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/by-measure/id896846969) in lieu of the text interviews, so artists can describe their process with audible words, rather than typed answers.

Dig into the work of this passionate archivist, and hear her story this week on Dispatch.
