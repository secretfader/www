  With a returning guest on the show, we tackle what's happened in the life of
  our friend Molly Marshall in 84 weeks since her last visit. The latest news so
  far is, #PodcastClub, a listening group for passionate fans of audio
  entertainment. We then springboard into a discussion for those interested in
  creating other community driven meetups, including how to avoid common
  pitfalls and discouraging mistakes.

Returning guest Molly Marshall is an insatiably curious artist, digital marketer, and event organizer. The last time she joined us was [Episode 1](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/dispatch/1), where we debated the merits of limiting your work to a single creative discipline.

Today she is back, after an 84 week hiatus. The latest news in her life is [#PodcastClub](https://twitter.com/hashtag/podcastclub) a meetup for passionate fans of on-demand audio entertainment. We cover the origins of this new project, pitfalls that await new event organizers, and more. Here at Dispatch, we love community events (and even lead a few). The world needs more organic communities, and creating them around loosely organized interest groups is a great way to kickoff new friendships. To Molly, and others like her, we say congratulations!

Also of note, Dispatch Live is returning to Chicago. March 26th at [Intuit Center for Outsider Art](https://www.facebook.com/events/645091565596602), we'll be hosting a panel covering the genesis of the outsider art movement, and how it empowers artists today. Don't miss this!
