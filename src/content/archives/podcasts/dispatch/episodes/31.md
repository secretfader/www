Look around. The world is brimming with talented, creative artists. It can be daunting to enter the workforce with little more than talent &mdash; and even the most resilient artists can become discouraged, searching for their place in the madness.

Joining Nicholas and Joshua today is Charles Riffenburg. Charles is a designer and strategist, who spends most of his time working for Chicago performing arts companies. Through his company, [Grab Bag Media](http://grabbagmedia.com), he's produced campaigns for Stage 773, BoHo Theater, and the Marriott Theatre.

As Charles' work represents, there are plenty of opportunities for the creative designers of today. The talent pool is far from full. Your work will find an audience.
