Whether you know it or not, there is a name for artists to were untrained, and had only a few ways to satisfy their urge to create. Outsider Art is a movement born in European mental hospitals, but the shockwaves from this creative institution extends well into the future. Along with Cleo Wilson, your hosts trace the impact of Outsider Artists from the beginning until today.

As you may notice, this week's broadcast didn't originate from our studio; instead, we come to you from [Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art](http://art.org) a fabulous gallery filled with work from Outsider Artists around the globe. Once monthly, we'll be hosting discussions like this from Intuit, and of course, streaming the show live.

In this hour, you'll learn more about untrained, intuitive artists than you ever thought possible. Prepare to be moved, and press play.
