As professional creatives, is it better to focus on a single area of work, or to generalize and serve a broader clientele? That's the topic of our conversation on this episode of Dispatch.

Welcome to Dispatch, an innovative talk show about issues that affect creators and their work. In the last decade, what it means to be an artist has changed drastically. We explore what it means to truly create - without any preconceived notions or rules - in a cluttered world. The world in 2013 is a busy place, but we're here to cut through the noise with common sense advice and unique perspectives.
