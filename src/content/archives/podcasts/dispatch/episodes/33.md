Today on Dispatch, a clear example of how to achieve that elusive work/life balance. Our guest is [Krista Seidl](http://kristaseidl.com), founder of Krista Seidl Design Company, and the creator behind many wonderful pieces of branding (including the [Original Machine](http://originalmachine.com) logo).

In the last year, Krista relocated from Chicago to the north woods of Wisconsin, and welcomed a new addition to her family. But in the midst of everything, she has remained creative, and even managed to gain new clients.

In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas chat with her, hoping to gain insight on how this new phase of life affected her business and design sensibilities.
