Cassettes are back, baby! Following on the tails of vinyl, this once beleagured format has returned and spawned a new generation of audio fanatics. As popularity surges again, many labels are opting to produce tapes over more-expensive compact discs.

This week, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Coach Weza, principal trainer and the resident dubbing specialist at [Athletic Tapes](http://athletictapes.bandcamp.com). We quiz him hard, asking what's behind this revolution in high quality analog audio.

Let's blast back to the 80's. This is Dispatch.
