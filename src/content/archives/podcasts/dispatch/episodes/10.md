This week, we offer a blueprint for success. Here's a preview: it isn't easy, but anyone can make a living with work they love. It requires hard work, drive, and diligent tending to your personal time management regimen.

Our guest, Ovetta Sampson, is now successful &mdash; but it wasn't always that way. After relocating to Chicago, she lost most of her previous clientele, only left with remnants of a journalism career in Colorado. Fast forward a few years, and she is a business owner, writing for a living, and training for *Ironman Cozumel*, an elite physical fitness challenge.

She has successfully integrated work into her life, not the other way around. For most, their employment rules: everything else revolves around their career. Not so for Ovetta; she lives by her own rules.

Listen and learn how to be a creative badass who sets their own schedule, and take over your life. Don't be a ragdoll to the universe and it's whims: you're the boss!
