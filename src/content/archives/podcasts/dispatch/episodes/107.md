  This week on Dispatch, we venture outside the comfortable world of our studio
  to visit with Michael and Becca McCracken, founders of Vagabond School of the
  Arts. Chicago is a city full of beautiful art, not the least of which is our
  thriving theater scene, which Vagabond serves with a collection of useful
  continuing education classes, curated and presented by the city's top talent.

This week on Dispatch, we venture outside the comfortable world of our studio to visit with Michael and Becca McCracken, founders of [Vagabond School of the Arts](http://vagabondschool.com). Chicago is a city full of beautiful art, not the least of which is our thriving theater scene, which Vagabond serves with a collection of useful continuing education classes, curated and presented by the city's top talent.

In this conversation recorded at their Ravenswood loft, we explore the story behind Vagabond, how Michael arrived in Chicago, joined up with Becca, and the trials of the entrepreneurial journey that they've embarked on. It's a show that you don't want to miss.
