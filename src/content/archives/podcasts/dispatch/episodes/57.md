  Most podcasts fade after several years. It's no wonder: behind the scenes of
  every broadcast, be it on terrestrial radio, satellite, or online, artists
  work long hours to deliver your favorite media fix. Some burn out, and
  discontinue their shows, while a far lesser number continue on. Today, we
  bring you a member of the latter category: Dave Warner. By day, he's mild
  mannered technical writer. At night, he's an influential online presenter, and
  host of "Dave's Lounge."

Most podcasts fade after several years. It's no wonder: behind the scenes of every broadcast, be it on terrestrial radio, satellite, or online, artists work long hours to deliver your favorite media fix. Some burn out, and discontinue their shows, while a far lesser number continue on. Today, we bring you a member of the latter category: Dave Warner. By day, he's mild mannered technical writer. At night, he's an influential online presenter, and host of "[Dave's Lounge](http://daveslounge.com)."

His online broadcasts began almost a decade ago, and since then, he's released over two-hundred hour-long episodes, each filled to the brim with music designed to help you chill. And in that time, he's acquired a significant amount of knowledge about podcasting, including how (and where) to host your media files, what content management system is the best, and how to nourish and grow your listener base.

Podcasting, as a medium, is still struggling to be accepted by the masses. It's not yet considered equal with television and radio, despite the obvious conveniences that it brings. What we need as podcasters is some sage advice. Today, Dave gives it to us.
