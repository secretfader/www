  It's Labor Day. In our home country of the United States, most everyone is
  relaxing, and telling stories around the bar-b-que grill. Meanwhile, Joshua
  and Nicholas convened in the studio to share six of our favorite tracks,
  accompanied by stories of how they found the artists. Today on Dispatch, it's
  six tracks, and the stories that connect them.

It's Labor Day. In our home country of the United States, most everyone is relaxing, and telling stories around the bar-b-que grill. Meanwhile, Joshua and Nicholas convened in the studio to share six of our favorite tracks, accompanied by stories of how they found the artists.

If you've been listening to the show for any length of time, you know there's no shortage of discussion regarding how artists should proceed when offering their work to a (hopefully) adoring public. Rarely do we offer tracks from artists who we personally enjoy, and to the best of our understanding, followed the path to success. So, while everyone is on break, it's time for us to exactly that. Today on Dispatch, it's six tracks, and the stories that connect them.
