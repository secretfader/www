Sometimes it pays to have a partner. They become your best friend, sounding board, and critical voice of reason when the work just isn't right. But you must choose carefully: this person will see you, and the work created together, at it's worst possible stage.

Joining us today are Matt and Gene, collectively known as [TWINKIDS](https://www.facebook.com/officialtwinkids), a newly-minted electronic music duo. Joshua and Nicholas speak to them about music, life in Chicago, their Banff center residency, and more.
