You may not know it, but neither our founder, Nicholas, nor the hosts make any money from their shows on The Machine. We have run "sponsorships" for our friends to help publicize their work, but in the end, it's all pro-bono. In fact, it costs us a lot to stay on the air, and continue delivering weekly programming to you.

Today, for the very first time, we're [giving you a way to contribute](http://nicholaswyoung.com/donate) financially. If you like our programming, and want to us to continue broadcasting week after week, we would greatly appreciate your support. This show is nearing 75 weeks of continuous programming (with one exception, during our studio move), so we're committed to creating the best, pro-grade programs. [Will you join us on this never-ending quest?](http://nicholaswyoung.com/donate) If you chose to donate monthly, we have some super-cool rewards... so get in on it!

Also in this episode, a recap of Nicholas' recent trip [to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QzAAvbI-9A) at [Nodevember](http://nodevember.org), where he detailed the back-end software stack that keeps us online, Joshua's relaxing Thanksgiving, and of course, your usual witty banter. Tune in, turn it up, and contribute! This is Dispatch.
