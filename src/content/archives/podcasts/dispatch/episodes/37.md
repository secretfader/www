Cincinnati natives [The Neutral Sound](https://soundcloud.com/theneutralsound) recently embarked on their first tour, spreading acoustic indie-soul across the midwest. During their Chicago stop, they visited with Joshua and Nicholas in The Machine studio.

This episode provides a rare glimpse into the life of a recently-formed independent band, traveling together for the first time. They graciously share the struggles, frustrations, and exhilarating moments that comprise their daily lives. As CD-sales waiver, many artists see touring as an alternate income stream. If you're considering life on the road, don't miss this show.

After 45 minutes of conversation, the band broke out instruments and we captured a wonderful live performance. It's the honest discussion you've come to expect and wonderful art, rolled together in one radio show.
