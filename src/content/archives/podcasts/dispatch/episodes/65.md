  We get it: artists are afraid of business. Potential entrepreneurs are too.
  But in a world where everyone is a wanna-be, a  select few stand out. They
  alone are the proud, the doers: the ones who chase their dreams and make them
  happen. Are you one of them? This week on Dispatch, your hosts are joined by
  powerhouse founder Marcus Whitney, who volunteers real answers to the problems
  facing tomorrow's business leaders.

In today's world, most people only subsist. They live daily without control over their life, career, or finances. And yet, they're afraid of the tool that could revolutionize their existence. I'm talking, once again, about business. If you're living off the crumbs of someone else's passion, slogging though the 9-5, have a tolerance for risk and are driven to succeed &mdash; this episode is for you.

Our guest is powerhouse founder [Marcus Whitney](http://marcuswhitney.com). As one of the driving forces behind Nashville's thriving business community, he knows a thing or two about building successful companies. And, unlike some, he recognizes that a growing venture always starts with one small seed: the dream of a founder.

This isn't Silicon Valley bullshit. (We all know the pitch of a snake-oil salesman: extreme growth, and a massive payout isn't required.) It doesn't require a huge pocketbook or millions in venture capital. Today's conversation is brimming with real talk about what it means to be a business owner, how to grow and shepherd your team, and much more. If you're ready to get in the game, listen and learn.
