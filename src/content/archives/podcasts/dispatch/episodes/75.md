All too often, we're driven by our work. And when unexpected life events creep in and disrupt our otherwise organized workflow, it can rattle the best of us. In this episode, we explore what happens when those worlds collide, and how to reassemble the resulting broken pieces.

Joining your hosts today is Christina Dennaoui, the artist behind electronic music project Volutes, and former guest on [Inside the Machine](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/inside-the-machine/40). Together, we share moments in our lives when being alive gets messy.
