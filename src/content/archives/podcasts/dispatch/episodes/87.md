Any creative, regardless of the medium they're in, should understand the value of their talent and how to effectively market themselves. In a world where artists must juggle multiple disciplines, it's important that they have a grasp of rudimentary business skills, in addition to mastering a specific craft.

In this broadcast, returning guest [Charles Riffenburg](http://grabbagmedia.com) shares a few examples from his work as a marketing and design consultant, and provides useful insight into the issues others might face when involved in similar projects.

If you, or someone you know makes a living from their art &mdash; this is an episode not to be missed.
