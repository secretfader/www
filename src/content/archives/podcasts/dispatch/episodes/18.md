Today, we step squarely into the intersection of business and art. How you profit from countless hours spent on your creations is an important topic for all creators, though few have mastered the balance of art and income so well as our guest.

In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Veronica Corzo-Duchardt, a Cuban-American designer and collector of historical artifacts. All of her projects leave a lasting effect on the viewer, but few stand next to _The Neche Collection_, a group of artifacts owned by her grandfather. In this exhibit, Corzo-Duchardt photographed items of note, and released them along with a series of artful posters inspired by her father's outlook on life.

Over the years, her work has been exhibited internationally and is held in permanent collections at _Newberry Library_, and the ZÃ¼rich _Museum of Design_. She currently lives in Chicago, IL, and operates [_Winterbureau_](http://winterbureau.com), her innovative design studio.
