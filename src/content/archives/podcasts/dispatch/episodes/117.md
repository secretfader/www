  Will YouTube's new premium content help it rise to the prevalence of Netflix?
  What happens when companies lash out against the government, pretending as if
  they were private citizens? Can you car safely operate on autopilot, or will
  "autosteer" cause a near-miss and give you a heart attack? We ponder these
  questions and more, serving them up alongside a cutting dose of sharp-angled
  critique.

For the one-hundred-and-seventeenth time, Joshua and Nicholas are behind the mic. After a short one-week break, they're ready to ignite your imagination with possibilities and new information. If you're new, welcome. For the seasoned listener, though, you'll recognize this format as one of our older moments: the old-school news roundup.

This week, we bring you three stories from around the digital universe, served up with our signature, sharp-angled critique.

First, will [YouTube's new premium content service](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34596219) help it rise to the prevalence of Netflix? Second, what happens when [companies lash out against the government](http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/22/9591596/airbnb-san-francisco-ad-campaign-proposition-f), pretending as if they were private citizens? And finally, [can your car safely operate on autopilot](http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/Automated_Vehicles_Policy.pdf), or will ["autosteer" cause a near-miss](http://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/some-tesla-owners-are-too-trusting-of-autopilot) and give you a heart attack? All this, plus a preview of our recent radio special, *[Chick Habit Live](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/chick-habit/14)* is all coming your way.
