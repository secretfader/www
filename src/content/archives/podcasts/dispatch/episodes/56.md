"Hey, you owe me money. Pay me the money," quips Joshua Wentz. It's a common phrase known to anyone in business. Whether you run a firm of your own, or work in the accounts receivable department somewhere else, it's important that you reclaim any money owed.

In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas discuss several ways to get paid. The main point? Be civil, every time, even though the client is hesitant to remit the owed funds.

Also in this episode, stories of Congress members editing Wikipedia anonymously, the value of Twitter Ads (versus Facebook's advertising system), and the morals of downloading copyrighted content on Bittorrent. Plus, we tell the story of our theme, "[Right Degrees](http://joshuawentzmusic.bandcamp.com/track/right-degrees)." It's a smorgasbord of ideas, both good and bad, this week on Dispatch.
