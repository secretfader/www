  Some artists prefer to tease an album for months, only releasing it at the
  height of interest. Others simply drop it, and depend on a tightly-knit
  community of fans to discover it and spread the word. In this episode, we
  outline three case studies, and discuss the perks or negatives to each method.

Your album is a musical portfolio, and some artists prefer to release it into the world carefully. Others simply drop it, and depend on a tightly-knit fan-base to discover and spread the word.

In this episode of Dispatch, Joshua outlines three major album release case studies, and the perks or potential negatives to each method.

It's a careful balance. Too much teasing can burn out your audience, but too little can cause you to lose release-day excitement.

Which is the best method? Is one clearly better than the other? We answer these questions, and others.
