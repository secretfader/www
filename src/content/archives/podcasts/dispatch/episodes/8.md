Let's be honest: the internet, and e-commerce specifically, is a boom for most creators. However, without careful planning and clear execution, the online shopping experience can quickly become impersonal. Virtual storefronts will never line our streets with beautiful shop windows, or welcome us with a friendly greeting as we step inside.

Our guest this week is Marco Chavarry, owner of [Alapash Meaningful Terrariums](http://www.alapash.com), a best of Chicago award-winning home furnishings store in Lincoln Square. His physical space serves as a creative retreat, messy workshop, and welcoming environment where clients can dream and plan their perfect living space.
