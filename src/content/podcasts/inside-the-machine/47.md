description: Outside of the pop-country system that dominates much of Nashville's
  mind-share, a new group of artists is growing. They draw from Music City's deep
  folk heritage, but spin their craft in a new direction, and there is no finer example
  of this style than Jacob Thomas Jr. Hear his story, and tracks from the recently
  released "Original Sin" full-length today on Inside the Machine.

In the church by day and bars by night, [Jacob Thomas Jr.](http://jacobthomasjr.com) knows what it's like to live a double life. One is lived out by your true self, and the other, as he would soon realize, is a lie.

Raised in an Assemblies of God congregation, there was a fine line between lives of the believers and unsaved souls outside church doors. Living in the church, where all was good and pure, you were forbidden from even associating with people who drank, smoked, and partied. As a musician, Jacob found these rules too constraining, and of course, was soon performing in dimly lit bars to support his artistic endeavors. One word from a congregant was all it took for church leaders to discover his late-night escapades and remove him from their staff.

Before you decry their actions, know that Jacob considers this move a blessing. As life fell apart, his true passions emerged: he was a storyteller, destined to inspire others with honest songwriting, hardened determination to succeed, and raw, unbridled passion.

Today, we present four tracks from his debut full-length, *Original Sin*, and the story of a true self-made artist.
