  Today on Inside the Machine, you'll hear from friend of the network,
  multi-instrumentalist, painter, and songwriter Randi Russo. Even though she
  embarked on her musical journey later than most, a late start didn't slow her
  down. With four albums to her name and numerous projects on the way, she's
  determined to keep digging until striking gold.

It doesn't matter when you begin, only that you start. For some of our guests, their musical journey began during their pre-teen years. Others came to music as an artform well into adulthood. This week's guest, [Randi Russo](http://randirusso.com), is somewhere in between. After witnessing her first potent rock show at age nineteen, she set out to pursue a life filled with honest lyrics and driving melodies. Four albums, three cities, and several years later, she is a staple in our music library and a major actor in Chicago's growing independent arts scene.

In this hour and a half conversation, we cover her origins as a visual artist, the initial journey into music (and out again), what it means to absorb a life altering medical diagnosis, and much more.

To staff here at The Machine, Randi is a pillar in our community and avid supporter of independent arts organizations (like us). She is [recognized and respected](https://programs/dispatch//3) for helping anyone who lifts others up, and we're grateful to know her. If you're a creative in need of encouragement, or you just want to know more about Randi, press play now.
