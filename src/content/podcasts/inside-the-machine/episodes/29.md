The story begins in 2009 with two friends and a stack of experimental music. Almost five years later, this Chicago duo is still going strong and aiming for their second release. In this hour, Nicholas visits with Megan Frestedt and Sam McAllister, co-founders of [Project Film](http://youloveprojectfilm.com).

While riding the line between Death Cab for Cutie and classic pop, their discography remains refreshingly original. Their musical signature is instantly recognizable, even in the most crowded of playlists.

Outside of producing their own music, Sam and Megan are principals of [Tandem Shop Records](http://tandemshoprecords.com). Together, they help deserving bands find success through honest collaboration and promotion.
