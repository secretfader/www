[Gramps The Vamp](http://grampsthevamp.com) began as several college buddies rehearsing groovy funk lines for a one-time Halloween party. The festivities kicked off, and their electrifying performance hooked the audience and members themselves. Now several years in, the band is one of Chicago's foremost "doom-funk" acts.
