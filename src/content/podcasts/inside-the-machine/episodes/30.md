Old speakers, tape recorders, and unique synthesizers each have a place in [Cinchel](http://cinchel.com)'s musical history. His work, that started as sketches on a simple four-track recorder in the early 2000's, has evolved: improving with each passing year. Today, he's crafting ambient tracks that seep into your thoughts, and become the soundtrack for whatever you're doing.

I first discovered Cinchel's work thanks to my friend (and previous guest on Inside the Machine) [XYZR_KX](/programs/inside-the-machine/28). At first, I wasn't into it: ambient music has never been my favorite. But over many months, it grew on me, becoming a source of inspiration and calm.

Cinchel's tracks are unique. Where most music forces you into a certain mindset, his exerts little influence. It's music for all occasions. But enough writing, it's time that you hear it. Whether you're working, playing, or traveling: press play to experience this special episode of Inside the Machine.
