A few weeks ago, I received a refreshing email. Lakshmi Ramgopal's debut solo record, "Sundrowned" had dropped days prior, and she shared it with me. She didn't pester me for an interview. She didn't toss press quotes in my face. Instead, she began a conversation. I read, then listened, and truly enjoyed what she had to offer.

Today, Lakshmi, the artist behind one of Chicago's greatest ambient projects, [Lykanthea](http://www.lykanthea.com), joins me in-studio to discuss her career, classical South Indian music, dance, and much more.
