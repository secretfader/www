The music industry at large is confused. In a world of formulaic pop, we need a hero: a symbol of power and clarity. We need a Hawk.

I've waited to release this interview for what seems like forever, although I know it was only a few weeks. This week,  I'm joined by Nashville dark-pop trio Dan Haseltine, Jeremy Bose, and Matthew Bronleewe, known collectively as [The Hawk In Paris](http://thehawkinparis.com).

Every week, I read commentary about a _groundbreaking_ new album, and eye it with suspicion. Each member of this trio has impacted the modern music industry in powerful ways, and together, they're unstoppable. In the face of their new album, _Freaks_, few artists retain their revolutionary title.

Press play to experience our hour-long conversation with the band, and the world premier of three new tracks.

## Featured Tracks

"Wake Me Up"

"Curse The Love Songs"
