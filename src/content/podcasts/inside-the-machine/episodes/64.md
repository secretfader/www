Whether we're discussing design, music, or photography... it can be difficult and time consuming to produce simple work. On today's episode of Inside the Machine, Nicholas is joined by Midwest rocker [Colin Morris](http://colinmorris.net) to discuss his debut EP, *[Could Be Anything](http://colinmorris.bandcamp.com)*, and why it took so long to create.

According to Colin, "You can spend a lot of years, trying to be something... trying to live up to your idea: the look, attitude, and disposition of someone who does what you want to do." This, friends, is a persistent challenge faced by all artists. There's a balance to be struck between planning your future moves and simply doing the work required to be successful.

In this hour, we discuss the line between planning and overthinking; work and life; dreams and reality. It's a great conversation that you shouldn't miss.
