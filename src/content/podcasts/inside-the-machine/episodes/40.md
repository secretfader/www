Plug in your headphones and press play. Today, we're going where few radio programs dare to go. Inspired by the basics of life, and tempered by the loss of her mother, [Volutes](http://www.volutesmusic.com)' latest release, Elegant Grey, is a departure from the normal roads of electronic music. Light, melancholy strings play softly against bombastic percussion in this 30-minute soundscape, drawing the audience ever deeper into her world of sound.

It's music at it's realest: in fact, you'd never know that it's a debut EP. The depth and warmth offered in this recording belies the project's age: Elegant Grey has the sonic fingerprint of projects more than twice it's senior. Each track is charming, while begging the listener to question and apply their own meaning to each one.

This conversation is not to be missed. Press play, and prepare to be wrapped in sonic bliss. Inside the Machine starts now.
