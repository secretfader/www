If you've heard Progress Report, Doc Waffles, Laura Finlay, or almost any artist from Detroit in recent years, chances are that you've heard [Eddie Logix](http://eddielogix.com) too. His work entered my radar after his collaboration with D. Allie on _The Cooperative_, and continued to amaze in his tighter collaboration _Eddie Logix and D. Allie are Progress Report_.

Long before independent hip-hop asserted it's prominence in The Motor City, he was making waves with [Midcoast Most](http://midcoastmost.com). Eddie is hip-hop, in it's truest sense. His work inspires those around him to improve and continue honing their craft, while supporting him financially. His personality exudes a healthy pride, and drive that few possess.

In this interview, we walk through his musical history, including early work with Midcoast Most, his collaborations with David Allie, and shine the spotlight on his latest release, [_Eddie Logix Plays Lykke Li_](http://eddielogix.bandcamp.com/album/eddie-logix-plays-lykke-li), an album inspired by samples of the actresses' music.
