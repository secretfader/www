Is this the "end of an era", a moment to be lamented, or the fade in to something bigger? Over the last 81 episodes, Inside the Machine has featured some of the finest musicians on the planet, but all good things must come to a close. In this final episode, Nicholas recaps his last year on the air with a celebratory broadcast featuring friends from around the country.

Joining him for this capstone broadcast are several of our best friends: [Greta Morgan](/programs/inside-the-machine/75), [Mark Helm](/programs/inside-the-machine/80), [Strawberry Jacuzzi](/programs/inside-the-machine/78), [Wave & Rome](/programs/inside-the-machine/77), [Lili. K](/programs/inside-the-machine/63), and [Karmacoda](/programs/inside-the-machine/68). Plus, there's a special playlist with tracks from [Fluerie](http://www.fleuriemusic.com), [Low Swans](http://www.lowswans.com), [Hard Femme](https://hardfemme.bandcamp.com), [Poema](http://www.poemamusic.com), [Bow & Spear](https://bowandspear.bandcamp.com), and [Ottawa](http://listentoottawa.com) &mdash; all great bands that we didn't have the chance to document.

Even though Nicholas is sunsetting Inside the Machine, it isn't the end of his on-air adventures. You can still hear him every week alongside Joshua Wentz on [Dispatch](/programs/dispatch/). Along with The Machine team, he's also working on a new show... It's currently top secret, but you'll hear soon enough.
