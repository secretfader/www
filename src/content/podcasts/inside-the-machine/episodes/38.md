As the original home of House, Chicago is no stranger to musical innovation. It's fostered many dance revolutions &mdash; drum and bass, and modern electronica all find homes in America's heartland &mdash; but certain genres are still struggling for mainstream acceptance. Today, Inside the Machine presents one band that's fighting for shoegaze... and winning.

Founded by Michael Tenzer in 2012, [Savage Sister](http://facebook.com/savagesisterband) has grew exponentially in the last two years. Even their migration from St. Louis to Chicago &mdash; a major move that could be detremental to almost any band's audience &mdash; didn't faze them. After relocating, the band added Caitlin Klask on bass and Chloe Lundgren on vocals, both talented creators in their own right, and rapidly expanded their discography.

The future is bright, and apparently, includes a lot of reverb. Press play, and we'll go Inside the Machine together.
