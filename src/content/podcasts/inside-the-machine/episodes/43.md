Will Farina specializes in improvised, live electronic music. With his array of analog synthesizers, many cables, and portable recorder, he's taught us many important auditory lessons. The importance of field recording and dynamic range are regularly covered in his studies. Today on Inside the Machine, he invites you to look behind the curtain.

Beginning with his 2010 project *Land & Sea*, Will embarked on a journey that would take him from the lush, warm climate of Tampa, Florida, to the frozen winters of Chicago, Illinois. Undeterred by the difference in temperature, he's happy here. And the music continues to flow, for which we're very grateful.
