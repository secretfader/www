From Nashville, Tennessee, we're joined today by [Dewveall](http://dewveall.com), a husband-and-wife duo who've been producing honest, compelling roots rock.

My first taste of their music came in the form of a live concert recording, and while those usually aren't the best, the band's on-stage banter and honest performance left me begging for more. A couple of years passed, and I received a pre-release single of their track *Runaway Sun* in my inbox. I donned my headphones, and pressed play. What greeted my ears was a driving, reinterpretation of southern Texas rock.

In 2012, they released [*Word*](http://dewveall.bandcamp.com/album/word), a record full of deep lyrical questions for the listener, mated with pop-infused melodies. Do not miss this record.

Finally, in 2013, they claim a spot here on *Inside the Machine*, joining the all-star cast of bands who chose to share their story.
