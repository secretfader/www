One year ago, [Rachel Solomon](http://rachelsolo.com) released her debut solo effort, "Love Ourselves". The album is a collection of tracks begging the listener to embrace who they are, without exceptions. But the record isn't encouragement only for fans: Rachel has found meaning in the lyrics she penned, applying them to experiences gained after the project was finished.

Her career began with an open casting call for the all-female rock band, Mustang Sally. After making the cut, Rachel toured with the band for several years, and had the opportunity to record a record in her new hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. But the hard-won success of life on the road was just the beginning for this talented performer.

Rachel soon retreated to the quiet life of her home, drafting lyrics to what would ultimately become her solo debut. Over the last year, Rachel has performed with many Nashville acts &mdash; keeping it mostly silent on her solo schedule &mdash; but 2014 is ripe as she invests in herself.

Today, we explore the real-world faced by working musicians around the country, as they balance outside projects with their true passion.
