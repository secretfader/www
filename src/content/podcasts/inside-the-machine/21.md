Las Vegas, Nevada: home to media prospectors, the party life, and one of my favorite bands, Modern Science. Since 2009, they've been kicking out funk jams from their private studio in The Entertainment Capital of the World.

Kane Churko and Mike McHugh both walked different paths to Vegas, but fate, it seems, planned Modern Science from the beginning. Churko, the son of famed producer Kevin Churko, moved with his family chasing a land purchase. McHugh, raised in the American midwest, relocated because of his father's employment.

Their paths intersect in the Vegas music scene, and the world has been different since. Press play to experience the band's entire story, including the world debut of their new track, "Game Changer".
