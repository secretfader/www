Several months ago, [Mereology](https:///programs/inside-the-machine/43), a friend of The Machine, introduced yours truly to a vintage rock band from Brooklyn, known as [Inner Outlaws](http://inneroutlaws.com). Today, my musical lexicon has been vastly expanded by this group of multi-talented groovemasters. And now, thanks to the magic of radio, you can experience my journey as well.

In 2012, several fortutious events &mdash; including the breakup of their previous band, *Spaces* &mdash; led to the formation of Inner Outlaws. Several jam sessions and performances later, their debut self-titled record was released into the world.

Now, with two releases and a third one on the way, this band is moving faster than almost any other. They proclaimed 2015 as "The Year of the Outlaw," and vowed to release one new single per month. So far, they've kept up with their monthly deadline.

Today we begin with a track that is only hours old, *King of Nothing*, dive back into the members' histories, and finish with the recording that, for me, started it all.
