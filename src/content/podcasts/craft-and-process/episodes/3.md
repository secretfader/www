Kombucha is a drink as varied as the people who consume it. The ingredients are simple: tea, sugar, a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), and juice to taste. Within those creative boundaries, a whole new branch of brewing is experiencing a renaissance.

Mostly non-alcoholic, the origins of kombucha can be traced to a Chinese emperor who sought the Elixir of Life. What he found was more of a life-giving substance than originally understood. Full of antioxidants and electrolytes, Kombucha is now a sought after drink for everything from sports recovery to making cancer treatment a bit more bearable.

Originally inspired by a need to help their daughter, On the Fence is now one of Colorado's foremost Kombucha producers, helmed by Lauren and Jed Wilson. Today on the program, we explore the health benefits, environmental impact, and processes behind making this wonderful beverage in their classic On the Fence style.
