A lot can change in 12 years, which is especially true in an industry that moves as fast as craft beer. This is a lesson Michael Memsic, Co-Founder of Sanitas Brewing, knows well. As one front range’s most innovative breweries, Sanitas has developed not only an iconic line of beers, but an ever expanding, inclusive community as well.

As one of the first canning employees at the famed Oskar Blues Brewery, Michael developed a love for the industry very early on, and left there not only with a passion, but a plan to someday open his own operation.

After nearly a decade at Boulder Beer, he had the experience to match the ambition, and in 2013, Sanitas Brewing was born in the craft beer capital of Boulder, Colorado. Nestled into the mountains, it’s a perfect place to sip and consider your next adventure. In 2023, the expansion to Englewood began, with Lafayette quickly following the next year. As Michael says, Sanitas is “on a tear” opening new locations, an effort they don’t see ending anytime soon.

Find one of the signature taprooms, find your drink of choice, alcoholic or not, and raise a glass to community.
