Welcome to Spell Books, Littleton's smallest bookshop. At a mere 800 square feet, this location is no Barnes and Noble, but for what they lack in space, they make up for in personality.

Owner Corey Dahl has always dreamed of owning a bookshop, and after their corporate job demanded a return to the office after the 2020 pandemic, they decided it was time to make a childhood passion a reality. Host Nicholas Young joins Corey just after the one-year anniversary of Spell Books opening for a long-form conversation covering the triumphs, struggles, and lessons learned.
