"About six or seven years ago I quit smoking, and needed to pick up a hobby," explains Craig Knutson. "I began taking guitar classes at the Old Town School of Folk Music. I had great instructors, and met some great people. I couldn't put the instrument down." So begins the story of [FolkThat.tv](http://folkthat.tv), a website designed to revitalize Folk, the somewhat ignored genre in our current music landscape.

Each month, Craig selects a popular tune, and solicits cover videos. The submitted videos are ranked by visitors, and the highest rated performance wins a prize. Older videos are archived under the "Old Folks" category, creating a library ripe with inspiration for seasoned and new musicians alike.

This relatively simple concept has united the worldwide Folk community, in a way Craig never imagined. This week, Craig joins Joshua and Nicholas in the studio to discuss the project's evolution, challenges he's faced while shepherding the Folk That community, and more.
