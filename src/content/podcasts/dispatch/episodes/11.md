Last week, we discussed the creative drive of an artist, and the burning desire to create something from nothing. That inclination is powerful, and continues to fuel the work of innovators worldwide, but what is the next step? Once your product, service, or work of art exists, how do you connect with potential customers?

Today, we attempt to answer that question, and provide actionable guidance. Our guest is Dave Delaney, social marketing strategist, community manager, and author of _New Business Networking: How to Effectively Grow Your Business Network Using Online and Offline Methods_.
