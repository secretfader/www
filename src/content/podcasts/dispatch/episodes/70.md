  Noktivo, a non-toxic spa in Ravenswood, Chicago.

You may not know it, but many mass-market cosmetics have chemicals that aren't always safe for your skin or the environment. There isn't a governing body controlling how these products are made, and according to our guest, almost anyone can bottle their concoction then label it for sale.

Today, we come to you from the intersection of small business ethics, financials, and personal care. Jenny, owner of [Noktivo](http://noktivo.com) non-toxic spa works daily to educate and serve her clientele in Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood. With each passing year, she makes a larger dent in the misinformation and confusion that surrounds these products.
