Copyright is confusing, I think we can all agree on that. Whether you're an artist seeking to protect your work, or a business who needs to license protected work, your rights may be clearly defined by the law, but they certainly aren't well publicized. What are your rights, and how do you protect them?

Copyright is a two-edged sword, and can help (or harm) us, depending on how we wield it. In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas chat with Stephen Wolfson, copyright attorney and law librarian, who helps dispel the confusion.
