Once again, the Dispatch team comes to you from Show of Hands, Chicago's premier independent design fair, with a host of interviews. We talk to the shoppers, vendors, and organizers of the event, without all of whom, the show wouldn't have been possible. It was a landmark production for Chicagoland makers, marking the first curated vendor list, only allowing in the best exhibitors.

If you missed [last week's episode](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/dispatch/22), it's full of more interviews with different creators. So if you enjoyed today's installment, dig into the archive.
