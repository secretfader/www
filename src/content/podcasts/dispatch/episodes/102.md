Eventually, old technologies will be altered and presented as new work. It's inevitable. But sometimes, these reintroduced platforms breathe new life into the mediums that birthed them. Today on Dispatch, a roundup of ideas that are arguably outdated, but might help us find new paths.

First, we dive into the legislation known as [Chicago's "cloud tax"](http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-chicago-cloud-tax-tech-reaction-bsi-20150702-story.html), a new, nine-percent fee that aims to profit from Spotify, Netflix, and other digital, remote services.

Next up, [North America is running out of IPv4 addresses](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/us-exhausts-new-ipv4-addresses-waitlist-begins/). This has no bearing on you as the average internet consumer, but it does mark a moment that advanced technologists (and ISPs) should pay careful attention to.

Then, has [Apple successfully reinvented radio with Beats 1?](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/2/8883215/beats-1-radio-apple-music-zane-lowe-first-24). Is it something truly new, or just a rebranding of existing radio formats?

And finally, a frank discussion of privacy in this digital age as [Plex's user forums are compromised](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/2/8887303/plex-hack-password-breach-ransom): what constitutes online safety?
