What can you and your neighbors do to decrease your ecological footprint? Conserve water? Check. Use your local recycling center? Check, again. But outside of these well known techniques, exists a world of possibilities that few but the most eco-savvy consumers recognize. In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas come to you live from [Greener Ravenswood](http://ravenswoodchicago.org), a local event where vendors and community members gathered to explore outside-the-box options to conserve the resources of their community.

In short, this event was the finest of its kind. While many initiatives focus on city-wide issues, your local community is a powerful driving force. Where a single voice will not be heard over the din of metropolitan officials, in their neighborhood, the comments of an individual will be considered and often, acted upon. Listen and learn how your community can become greener, one step at a time.
