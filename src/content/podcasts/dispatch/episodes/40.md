---
Looking at well-known artists, the scope and amount of their work is often staggering. How do they manage it all? What is the secret to staying creative and doing work you love?

While there isn't a skeleton key to unlock your hidden potential, we can tinker with how your brain and life already function. In this special episode of Dispatch, we explore the seemingly endless discussion centered around finding your ideal work flow. You're heard big-name critics and life-hacks specialists chatter on endlessly, but it's time for our take. 

Today, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Susan Young, host of Randomnimities, for the last Dispatch at our first studio. Each host's job has unique demands, and they all have different productivity strategies. Listen, and be inspired to create your own.
