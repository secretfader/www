As artists, why do we create? For some, it's to educate: to present an alternative version of the world where all is right. Others create satire that illustrates the problems present in modern society, while being humorous. Yet another group is content with introducing beauty into an otherwise drab environment.

Ask anyone this question, and the answers you'll receive will vary wildly from one person to the next. Everyone has their own take, and rightly so: it's important to every fiber of their being; at work and play.

Today on Dispatch, we cover those questions and more with Nick Butcher and Nadine Nakanishi, founders of the renowned Chicago-based design firm, [Sonnenzimmer](http://sonnenzimmer.com). Over the last decade, their work has been defined by a unique desire to subvert how art is created and experienced. Along the way, they've become recognized internationally for unflinching honesty and openness, both in how they communicate with audiences, and in the work itself.

In this episode, we reflect on a decade of Sonnenzimmer, their upcoming gallery exhibition, *[Simultaneous: Seripop and Sonnenzimmer](http://sonnenzimmerandseripop.tumblr.com)*, what it means to grow as a creative, and the 2015 plans of this dynamic duo.
