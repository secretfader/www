Some people believe ideas are currency, and if that's true, should your ideas be protected? Today, we discuss the common action of having interested partners sign an NDA, or non-disclosure agreement, and how these binding legal documents can help (and sometimes harm) your ability to do business.

Like most episodes of Dispatch, this topic was inspired by the previous week's experiences. In Nicholas' case, he declined to sign for a number of reasons. Your reasons may be different, and we certainly aren't lawyers, but you can learn a lot from examining the reasons why someone may ask all parties to agree in writing.

This is a shorter episode than normal, but still packed with lots of useful information. Have you been in a sticky legal situation that slowed your business? Give us a ring: 1 (844) 4-MACHINE and share your story.
