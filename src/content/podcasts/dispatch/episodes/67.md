title: It's All Your Fault
---
Ah, the internet. It's both the single most powerful tool of our generation, and the most loathsome. It spawned a new generation of entrepreneurs, hungry for cash and fame; and has accelerated human progress all at the same time.

On today's broadcast, we focus on that entity: the world wide web, and the consequences of sharing private information with friends (and strangers) through modern technologies.

First on the table, [Snapchat says their users are at fault for a recent breach of trust](http://wired.com/2014/10/the-snappening-is-not-your-fault/). Then, continuing the string of alleged hacks, [Dropbox denies that it's system remains uncompromised](https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/10/dropbox-wasnt-hacked/), stating "the usernames and passwords referenced ... were stolen from unrelated services." We wrap with the news of [Skype's revamped video messaging app, Qik](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/10/skype-jumps-on-the-short-message-bandwagon-with-qik-video-messenger/), and a [tiny box that anonymizes all of your online activity](http://wired.com/2014/10/tiny-box-can-anonymize-everything-online/).

It's a round-up of everything you don't need to know, but is interesting nevertheless.
