Art is a known cultural intersection. One genre influences another, performers share techniques, stories, and tips for success. We know this, and as music critics, typically champion genre-spanning collaborations. That said, what happens when you break the standard code of ethics that define how to properly attribute your influences?

In this episode, we take on this very question. How can artists, record labels, and producers politely nod to their heroes without copying their work?
