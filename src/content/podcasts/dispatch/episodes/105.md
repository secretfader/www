If you want to hear for a lifetime, take care of your ears. Unfortunately, many among us (musicians and audio engineers included) don't quite understand what this takes. After this program, though, it will all become clear.

The key is this: our ears weren't designed for the rigors we face today. Live music, city noise, and overly loud earphones can all permanently damage our hearing. That's right: hearing loss isn't unavoidable... with perfect protection, you can hear perfectly forever.

In a world where one of your most important senses is constantly under assault, how can you mitigate your exposure to loud noise? Our guest, Carolynn Travis from [Earlove](http://earlove.net) can help.
