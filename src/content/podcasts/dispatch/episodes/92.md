title: Art is for Everyone
---
It doesn't matter what your race is, what religion you belong to, or whether you're male or female &mdash; art is for everyone. We strongly believe that anyone can create stunning works of art, and that nobody should be criticized for wanting to do so.

Unfortunately, our expectations rarely match reality. That's why we're launching [Chick Habit](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/chick-habit) a show chronicling the true-life events of female musicians in the Chicagoland area and beyond. 

Today on Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by [Ashly Dalene](http://nicholaswyoung.com/people/ashly-dalene) friend of the network, musician, and soon to be host of this dynamic new program. Get a taste of her personality, style, and backstory before the show releases it's first episode on April 22. Then, [subscribe](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/chick-habit) to get all the potent talk you can handle!
