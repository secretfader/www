Outside the world of traditional stage performances exists a world of experimental theater, where raw emotion reigns supreme. Venture outside of established genres, and you'll find funny, offbeat, and sometimes mildly offensive presentations from exquisitely talented performers, pouring their soul out on-stage. Welcome to The Fringe.

In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by [Laura Force Scruggs](http://lauraforcescruggs.wordpress.com), Fringe Central Coordinator for the 2013 Chicago Fringe Festival, and playwright behind "Punk Grandpa," a veritable flip-book of memories dedicated to her late grandfather. We discuss the world of underground theater, how to find your ideal mentor, and much more.
