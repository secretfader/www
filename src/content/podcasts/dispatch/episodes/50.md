In the past, protecting your work meant limiting it's exposure. Licenses stood in the way, between what users could, or could not do. But in the internet age, if a creator wants to retain strict control, do these principals still hold true? Today on Dispatch, photographer [Rich Myers](http://richemyers.com) joins Joshua and Nicholas for a lively conversation, where he describes a new approach to content licensing.

A self-proclaimed documentarian, Rich recently returned from Ukraine, where he routinely put himself in harms way just for the one, magical photograph. [All of his work is available online, for free, to any visitor](http://richemyers.com/about/a-note-on-photo-presentation). Commercial clients (such as news organizations), however, will need to pay a licensing fee. Despite this distinction, all of his images are downloadable in full-resolution and un-watermarked, on his website. Is this the future of our digital work? How do we control the propagation of our art, in this digital realm? Can we control it?
