What risks are acceptable? Opening a business and pursuing your own destiny is certainly fraught with danger, but how do you divide risks that are worth taking from the ones you should avoid?

For one, it's difficult to skirt the law where matters of  intellectual property are involved. In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas examine the case of [several Chicago bars who were recently sued by ASCAP](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150529/wicker-park/fatpour-kirkwood-bar-slapped-with-federal-copyright-infringement-lawsuits) for infringing copyrights of songwriters.

How could these establishments have avoided the hefty fines? For one, they could've kept it quiet. Second, they should've been using [Mixdown](http://mixdown.co), a project that Nicholas has been working on in his off time from Producer duties at The Machine.

All in all, this is a great conversation and not to be missed. Plus, a special thanks to Larissa and Chuck, our donors of the month, who contributed to help keep us on the air.
