It's time to talk writing. This hour on Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Collin and Ben, founders and instigators of the [Wasted Pages Writers' Workshop](https://facebook.com/wastedpages). Each week at the [Chicago Publishers' Resource Center](http://chiprc.org), they help fellow authors bone up on grammar, narrative storytelling, and everything else that makes a great work. We'll see if they can clean up our shownotes!

Jokes aside, if you're a writer in the Windy City, you should attend one of their events. It's only $30, a presents a great opportunity to write and be critiqued in a safe, constructive environment. Plus, laying down that cash will (hopefully) motivate you to draft your next masterwork.
