It's rare to chat with an artist who has just embarked on their career. This week on Dispatch, we get a glimpse into the life of Emily Ember. Nicholas encountered Emily while working at the Chicago Fringe Festival this past weekend. She was volunteering as a stage director, and handling all of the setup, teardown, cleanup, and light cues for several independently produced plays. Several short conversations later, and here she is, recording Dispatch.

Emily is a extraordinarily talented and focused young actor. As a recent graduate from Northwestern University, she's preparing to step out into the real world. She has a "survival job", but is planning on pursuing her calling with a driving passion that few artists possess. Expect great things from her in the Chicago theatre and around the country.

In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas chat with her about the realities of life as an artist. If you're beginning an artistic career, do you need a plan outside of your true career? We answer this question, and many more. Press play now.
