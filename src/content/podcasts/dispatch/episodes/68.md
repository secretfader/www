Before Nicholas goes on vacation, your hosts are meeting in the studio so you don't go without a program. And since it's on our minds, we discuss how to avoid burning out before you need to rest.

Don't overexercise your creative muscles. Learn to stop, pause your activities, and relax. Burning the midnight oil may make you seem extraordinarily productive, but in too many sessions of insane, nonstop work can wear you out &mdash; and lead to subpar output. Learn to know your limits, and live within them.
