Before signing your rights away, it's best to understand the rules. Before penning a controversial article, you should check your cultural sensibilities. Today on Dispatch, we round up the most important news, beginning with Apple Music and end on the censorship of historical artifacts.

First on the docket, [Shepard Fairey](http://www.artnews.com/2015/06/25/warrant-issued-for-shepard-faireys-arrest-in-detroit) is wanted in Detroit for vandalism. We discuss whether his work &mdash; outside of a commissioned work &mdash; constitutes destruction of property, or is it, like everything else he is credited with, art.

Next, we swing into the world of music royalties to touch on [Eternify](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33255037) an app created to game Spotify's revenue system. What does this say about music streaming platforms at large, and how should artists (properly) fight back against [ever-decreasing royalties](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2015/06/23/breaking-apple-paying-just-0-002-per-stream-during-its-free-trial-period)?

Then, we ask why the [U.S. Government is using Windows XP](http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-navy-pays-out-millions-to-microsoft-to-keep-running-windows-xp/), a software platform with almost 14 years of history, and was retired last year. Nicholas, for one, is afraid of the repercussions this has for other, crucial government services.

And finally, should we destroy all [references to the Confederate Battle Flag](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/06/25/apple-removes-civil-war-games-confederate-flag), or is it a crucial part of our history? Perhaps the uses of it in modern culture are misguided, but [how far can we police cultural heritage](http://nypost.com/2015/06/24/gone-with-the-wind-should-go-the-way-of-the-confederate-flag)? Is attempting to do so dangerous?

That, and more, is all coming up on Episode 101 of Dispatch. Press play and engage your brain.
