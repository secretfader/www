In this episode, Nicholas and Joshua explore a few items that you should check out. Often, we become so caught up in producing media (be it on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or broadcasts such as this one) that we forget about the myriad of wonderful creators around us. 

Today's show is all about recommending things you should listen to, watch, read, or buy.

We start everything off with a couple of new stories, provide a couple of steps that will help solidify the FCC's position on Net Neutrality, then we jump into recommendations. At the end, listen to hear more about Joshua's new project [Split Secret](http://splitsecret.com).
