As seasoned radio makers, it isn't often we get into deep conversations about how (and why) we create the programming you experience each week. But today, we had a unique opportunity to do just that. 

In this hour, we're joined by our new friend Annabel Lang, an intern at the famous [Third Coast Audio Festival](http://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/). As a recent inductee into the world of radio creators, Annabel has several questions for your hosts, which hopefully will explain why (and how) we continue to make audio-only programming.

Audio programming, especially online, is currently seeing a renaissance &mdash; with programs like *[Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/)*, *[Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/)*, and *[Start Up](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/)* &mdash; but many shows have had online distribution for years. Why are so many listeners consuming their shows on-demand now? We dig into this question, and many more, this week on Dispatch.
