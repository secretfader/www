It's not often that our guests bring physical product into the studio. Most of our friends create intellectual property, but few are as ambitious with physical product. Today, we break the mold with Phalkun Phoeng and Morris Jamlang, founders of [Equilibrium Urban Survival Gear](http://equnit.com).

Together, they're re-inventing the backpack in a radical way, that will improve how you live, work and play. Before we went on the air, Morris disassembled (and re-assembled) his pack, demonstrating that the Equilibrium system is truly "like legos for backpacks".

It all starts with a basic messenger bag, outfitted with numerous mount points available for extension. Snap on their fitted harness to wear it on your back. Then add a [Skyn](http://equnit.com/equilibrium/shop/category/skyns) to make the design your own.

We've been impressed by every guest who joins us for [Dispatch](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/dispatch), but Phalkun and Morris left a lasting impression on us even after the microphones were off. Join us for an engaging, hour-long conversation covering business law, patent applications, and inspired design.
