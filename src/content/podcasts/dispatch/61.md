[Brad Eshbach](http://bradeshbach.com) loves space. Yes, I'm referring to the dark, airless, void that seems to swallow all. But more specifically, he admires the proud few explorers who routinely visit and run experiments for the good of all mankind. In fact, Brad is so in love with those explorers that he created an iPhone app and website, "[How Many People Are In Space Right Now?](http://howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com)" Today, your intrepid hosts chat with Brad about his creation.

Like most ventures, it started with an idea, and one that Brad had no idea how to build. He's a idea guy, with vision and marketing skills &mdash; but his technical prowess is lacking. The good thing? He knows it.

To craft this beautiful, functional, and dare I say it, inspirational app, he partnered with several creatives who are each talented in their own right. Listen to hear stories of collaboration, frustrating missed deadlines, and ultimately, triumph.
