In this episode, we speak with [Elisha-Rio Apilado](http://erioapilado.com), a Chicago based designer who recently accepted a full time job, and how Her previous career as a freelancer, factored into the decision.

Much of her work focuses on blending design and philanthropy, in a combination she playfully explains as 'philarthropy'. Both Joshua and Nicholas are happy to have her on Dispatch.

Today's topic, if it isn't obvious, is juggling your life and career: where do the two meet, and can independent creators find balance? How do you determine whether freelancing or a full-time position is the path for you?

It's the deep artistic questions you always asked yourself, now we answer them on Dispatch.
