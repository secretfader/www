Failure. To creatives, it's probably the single scariest thing of their career, but it doesn't define your work, unless you let it. This week, we take on the big F-word, in art, life, and agribusiness.

Our guest is Karen Warner, CEO, CFO, and Chief Farmer at [Big Head](http://www.bigheadfarm.com), a south Michigan organic farm, growing vegetables, herbs, flowers and fruit in a way that doesn't hurt the environment, nor the people who consume them.

Together, we learn that it doesn't matter where you begin. If you're depressed, confused, or frustrated, the universe always offers a way up &mdash; Karen, and her story, are proof of that.
