description: Popular artists and entrepreneurs often recoil at the lash-back when
  the public doesn't disagree with their opinion, or if formerly secret conversations
  are unleashed for the world to see. Though not all of us are in a similar position,
  what if we hope to be? Who wouldn't accept the adoration of fans or users? It's
  best that we learn now to choose our words carefully.

title: Mind What You Say
---
This week on Dispatch, a news-roundup loaded with off-base comments from popular artists and tech entrepreneurs. This begged us to ask, when your opinion matters, what should (or shouldn't) you be allowed to say? How can creatives speak constructively, without unnecessarily tearing down their fellow man, but also with honesty?

Listeners, as your career grows, be sure to mind what you say. Because it might just come back to you.
