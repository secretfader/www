Big Moves. When you're planning your next live show. When you're recording your next, revolutionary album. When you're ready for something other than the ordinary, bust out the big guns and step into the spotlight. It's your time to evolve, to push forward; going farther than you have before. It's a chance to vanquish fear and doubt; to rely on your instincts as an artist. It's time to be big, bold, and make your move.

Joshua's band, [Brash Flair](http://brashflair.com), is deftly executing a set of bold decisions that will, we hope, contribute to their lasting success. Nicholas, head of The Machine, has been revamping his marketing strategies, and planning the next evolution of our broadcasting network. Both of your hosts are making their moves: how about you?

In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas share advice for creatives who are plotting their own version of world domination, and discuss how to evade the traps that can lead to ruin. Step out from the pack, and prepare to reinvent yourself.
