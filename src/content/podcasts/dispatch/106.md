---
A majority of the world's citizenry views media bias as a specter to be feared. We all know the game: talking heads on television spin, distort, and omit items from true accounts until there is little of the original story left. But what if we could infiltrate the propaganda machine, make our own media, and use "bias" to influence the conversation for good?

This is a premise put forth by Nicholas over the last week. It's based on an assumption that media outlets *must* choose stories to cover, and even in that act, a company that otherwise prides itself on high journalistic ideals, is introducing bias. The stories that are chosen &mdash; and the ones that aren't &mdash; both represent biases, each in a different direction, depending on where you stand in relation to the issue in question.

With all of the airtime that was recently soaked up by Rachel Dolezal, and then, layered on top, the death of Sandra Bland and the soldiers in Memphis, it's time that we take a hard look at how media bias is transforming our society, for the better or worse.

As journalists, we have a duty to select stories that will (and should) influence the national conversation. If we choose wrongly, public discourse suffers. Choose correctly, and we can teach an important lesson.

In this hour, your hosts are joined by [Derrick Clifton](https://www.facebook.com/DerrickCliftonWriter), friend of the network and Deputy Opinions Editor at [The Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com/authors/derrick-clifton). Derrick is no stranger to conversations that spring from intersections in our cultural road, and can be heard on [Episode 9](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/dispatch/9) of Dispatch as well.
