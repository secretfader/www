Nicholas Young is a storyteller and creative director whose work bridges the worlds of technology and the humanities.

He is the founder of [Fictive Flame](https://fictiveflame.co) a creative studio which draws techniques from the world of documentary filmmaking to craft bold, human-centric narratives for clients of all sizes. He is also an [FAA Part 107](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators) certificate holder, accomplished professional drone pilot, and the designer behind the [Fictive Air series of high-performance, sub-250g FPV cinematic aircraft](https://fictiveflame.co/blog/fictive-air-an-american-made-sub250g-cinematic-aircraft/); making Nicholas a valued asset to high-stakes productions where safety, reliability, and creativity are required.

An early contributor to both the Rust and Node.js programming language ecosystems, Nicholas helped shape the landscape of modern open source development, ensuring security and ease of use at each stage. He was also part of the first wave of podcasters, launching a network of shows and a supporting creative agency from Chicago&mdash;efforts that played a formative role in the medium's early development.

In 2016, shortly after relocating to Colorado, Nicholas received a life-altering diagnosis, which eventually led to the amputation of his right leg below the knee in late 2018. Efforts to remain active only damaged the remaining sound limb, which was amputated in early 2020. Since then, he has become a visible advocate and adaptive athlete; cycling, hiking, and running across rugged terrain.

Today, Nicholas continues to tell stories that explore themes of adaptation, creativity, and the interconnectedness of disciplines&mdash;both through his work at Fictive Flame Media and his broader creative practice.
