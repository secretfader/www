Nicholas Young is a Colorado-based engineer, filmmaker, designer, and creative director whose work bridges the worlds of technology, art, and storytelling. As an early contributor to both the Rust and Node.js programming ecosystems, he helped shape the world of modern open source development. He was also among the first wave of podcasters, and went on to launch a network of shows from Chicago, all of which were formative in the medium's early growth.

Nicholas is the founder of [Fictive Flame Media](https://fictiveflame.co), a visual and interactive design studio focused on documentary storytelling and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Through the company, he brings bold, human-centered narratives to life, blending technical precision with emotional depth. He is also a certified Part 107 remote pilot, providing aerial imaging across the country.

Nicholas also works as an interdisciplinary design and engineering consultant, where his ability to merge innovation with aesthetic insight makes him a valued partner on projects that demand both vision and versatility.

After moving to Colorado in 2016, Nicholas faced a life-altering diagnosis that led to a double amputation. He has since become a visible advocate and adaptive athlete&mdash;cycling, hiking, and running across the rugged Colorado landscape. His story has been featured in Bicycling Magazine and on local television for his resilience and athleticism.

Today, Nicholas continues to tell stories that explore themes of adaptation, creativity, and the interconnectedness of disciplines&mdash;both through his work at Fictive Flame Media and his broader creative practice.
