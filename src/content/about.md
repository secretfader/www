Nicholas Young is a Colorado-based filmmaker, designer, engineer, certified remote pilot, custom drone builder, and creative director. His work bridges the worlds of technology, art, and storytelling.

He is the founder of [Fictive Flame](https://fictiveflame.co) a creative studio which draws techniques from the world of documentary filmmaking to craft bold, human-centric narratives for clients of all sizes. He is also an [FAA Part 107](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators) certificate holder, accomplished professional drone pilot, and the designer [behind the Fictive Air](https://fictiveflame.co/blog/fictive-air-an-american-made-sub250g-cinematic-aircraft/) series of sub250g aircraft: making Nicholas one of the most in-demand pilots at high-stakes productions where safety, reliability, and creativity are required.

An early contributor to both the Rust and Node.js programming language ecosystems, Nicholas helped shape the landscape of modern open source development, ensuring security and ease of use at each stage. He was also part of the first wave of podcasters, launching a network of shows and a ssupporting creative agency from Chicago&mdash;efforts that played a formative role in the medium's early development.

In 2016, shortly after relocating to Colorado in 2016, Nicholas received a life-altering diagnosis that led to a double amputation. Since then, he has become a visible advocate and adaptive athlete: cycling, hiking, and running across Colorado's rugged terrain.

Today, Nicholas continues to tell stories that explore themes of adaptation, creativity, and the interconnectedness of disciplines&mdash;both through his work at Fictive Flame Media and his broader creative practice.
