description: General rules regarding content published on this site and other media properties.
---

This website, the YouTube channel of the same name, and any other associated content is produced with one goal: to explore, educate, and spark curiousity&mdash;honestly and transparently.

## Content Integrity and Review

An article, video, or other content is only labeled as a *review* if it includes hands-on experience with a product and offers subjective opinions based on direct use. It also means no money was exchanged for the purposes of creating that content, since accepting payment would jeopardize editorial independence.

Any sponsorships or other paid engagements will be disclosed here on this page, and never tied to a post that is labeled as a "review."

## Risk and Liability

Any comments made in a review, tutorial, or other video stand on their own, and are not a recommendation that you should do the same. If you attempt anything seen or described here, you do so at your own risk.

## Store Purchases

All digital products&mdash;templates, guides, software, LUTs&mdash;are non-refundable. Once the product is delivered to your email address, the sale is final. Listed prices are exclusive of any taxes or transaction fees; those are added at checkout, and the responsbility of the purchaser. While the store may calculate these amounts for the cart as a convenience factor, it is the purchaser's duty to comply with all local tax and import laws.

## Data Collection and Privacy

As part of serving this website to you, your IP address is automatically collected upon visit (unless blocked by a VPN or other privacy tool). If you make a purchase or sign up for updates, other personal information may be collected, including but not limited to: name, email address, phone number, and address.
By using this site, you acknowledge and consent to this collection as part of website operations and transaction processing.
