Weighing less than your typical remote at takeoff and able to fly anywhere, Ember is the camera putting viewers in the action. With it's smaller props compared to [Cinder](../cinder) and [Flare](../flare), it's noticably quieter than either 2.5" build while retaining similar throttle response.

Built around the DJI O4 Air Unit and carrying a full Remote ID and GPS package, this drone is designed as the perfect all-rounder for cinematic FPV.
