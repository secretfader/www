Weighing less than your typical remote at takeoff and able to fly anywhere, Ember is the flying camera putting viewers in the middle of the action.

With smaller props (2" vs 2.5"), it's noticably quieter than [Cinder](../cinder) or [Flare](../flare), both of which were engineered to lift an action camera in addition to their dry weight.

Built around the DJI O4 Air Unit and carrying a full Remote ID and GPS package, this drone is designed as the perfect all-rounder for cinematic FPV.
