Spark is one of a few modified bind-and-fly drones in the fleet. What began as a stock Firefly 18 Nano Baby 1S V3 has been modified with a new filter and PID tune, 3D printed PETG prop guards, new props, and a non-standard canopy with a GPS mount.

Built mostly for fun and freestyle practice, Spark is often referred to as a "therapy drone," since it forces the pilot into a state of flow with the tiny props and highly reactive flight style. Spark is also a development tool for my FPV racing and build club, [Prop Culture](https://propculturefpv.com), since it allows me to experiment with new features on micro builds without worrying about grounding an existing aircraft.
