Spark began life as a stock Flywoo Firefly 18 Nano Baby 1S V3 bind-and-fly drone. Once in Colorado, it was upgraded with a new filter and PID tune, 3D printed PETG prop guards to replace the brittle stock ones, 40mm tri-blade props (it arrived with 45mm bi-blades), and a non-standard canopy with GPS. After about a month, the motors were replaced to support speedier indoor maneuvers.

Built mostly for fun and freestyle practice, Spark is often referred to as a "therapy drone," since it forces the pilot into a state of flow with it's agility and highly reactive flight style.

Spark is also a development platform for [Prop Culture](https://propculturefpv.com), a Colorado-based FPV drone building and racing club.
