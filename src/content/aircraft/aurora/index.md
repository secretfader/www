Created as a gift for a very special pilot, Aurora is a high-performance racing and freestyle drone built on the chassis of a Flywoo Firefly 18. On top of that frame, it's anything but stock.

Featuring the most powerful 1002 motors on the market, the smallest GPS unit, shielded signal wires, a dipole antenna for the receiver, HQ ultralight whoop props, and a custom PETG bumper, Aurora is ready for action indoors, on the track, and at the park.
