As the first aircraft in the fleet, Flare has a high bar to maintain. The result of extreme engineering in service of sports broadcasting, this drone's first full day of work was at the 2025 Littleton Twilight Criterium, a massive stage on which to debut our newest flight technologies.

Permitted to fly at 25' (and lower) over the race course, this drone and its expert pilot flew amongst the action, giving viewers a front-row seat and setting a new bar for speed, agility, and safety in aerial imaging.

It was also the tool used to showcase architecture at the Jefferson County Library, and the craftmanship at many local businesses around the Denver metro. When time is of the essence and the shot counts, send up Flare.
