Designed to fly even after nightfall, Cinder was the second design in the Fictive Air fleet. It has permanently mounted navigation LEDs and mounting points for brighter strobe packages, neither of which push it over the sub-250g limit.

These features, along with the agility that is only offered by the Fictive Air series of cinewhoops, make it the ultimate FPV aerial system, day or night.

Built on a highly customized Cinequads' frame, this drone is also capable of carrying dual action cameras: one in the front and rear, enabling dynamic chase sequences to be captured in a single pass.
