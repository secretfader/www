Spark is one of a few modified bind-and-fly drones in my fleet. What began as a stock Firefly 18 Nano Baby 1S V3 has been modified with a new filter and PID tune, 3D printed PETG prop guards, new props, and a non-standard canopy with a GPS mount.

Built mostly for fun and freestyle, Spark is often referred to as my "therapy drone," since there's one activity that helps me let go: flying. It's also a development tool for my FPV racing club, [Prop Culture](https://propculturefpv.com), which allows me to experiment with new features on micro builds without worrying about breaking an existing drone.
