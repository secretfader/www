Designed to fly equally well before and after nightfall, Cinder is the second cinewhoop in the fleet (commissioned shortly after [Flare](/aircraft/flare)). It has permanently installed navigation LEDs and mounting points for brighter strobe packages, neither of which push it over the sub-250g limit. If necessary, it can be operated with full ducts, providing enhanced safety even over prop guards.

Built on a highly customized Cinequads frame, this drone is also capable of carrying dual action cameras, in the front and rear, enabling dynamic chase sequences in a single flight.

These features, along with the agility that is only offered by the Fictive Air series of cinewhoops, make it the ultimate FPV aerial system, day or night.
