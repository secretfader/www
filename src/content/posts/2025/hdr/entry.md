When I launched my YouTube channel in the winter of 2024, I dedicated much of the content to explaining complex topics though the lens of engineering. The idea was to apply processes that I use when breaking apart concepts in software and cybersecurity to problems that are more often encountered by visual storytellers. Week after week, as the number of videos and views both continued to grow, I couldn't help but look aside at other, more successful creators. I took inspiration from their production workflows, gear choices, and ethos on thumbnail design, but one choice always stood out, regardless of who you were following: the seemingly intentional choice to ignore high dynamic range.
