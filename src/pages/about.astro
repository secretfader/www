                Nicholas Young is a Colorado-based engineer, filmmaker,
                designer, and creative director whose work bridges the worlds of
                technology, art, and storytelling. As an early contributor to
                both the Rust and Node.js programming ecosystems, he helped
                shape the world of modern open source development. He was also
                among the first wave of podcasters, and went on to launch a
                network of shows from Chicago, all of which were formative in
                the medium's early growth.

            <p class="text mt-4 lg:mt-8 lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl">
                Nicholas is the founder of Fictive Flame Media, a creative
                studio focused on documentary storytelling and
                cross-disciplinary collaboration. Through the company, he brings
                bold, human-centered narratives to life, blending technical
                precision with emotional depth.
            </p>
            <p class="text mt-4 lg:mt-8 lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl">
                Nicholas also works as an interdisciplinary design and
                engineering consultant, where his ability to merge innovation
                with aesthetic insight makes him a valued partner on projects
                that demand both vision and versatility.
            </p>
            <p class="text mt-4 lg:mt-8 lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl">
                After moving to Colorado in 2016, Nicholas faced a life-altering
                diagnosis that led to a double amputation. He has since become a
                visible advocate and adaptive athlete&mdash;cycling, hiking, and
                running across the rugged Colorado landscape. His story has been
                featured in Bicycling Magazine and on local television for his
                resilience and athleticism.
            </p>
            <p class="text mt-4 lg:mt-8 lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl">
                Today, Nicholas continues to tell stories that explore themes of
                adaptation, creativity, and the interconnectedness of
                disciplines&mdash;both through his work at Fictive Flame Media
                and his broader creative practice.
