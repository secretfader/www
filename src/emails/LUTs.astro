    <p>Welcome, {firstName}</p>
    <p>
        Thanks for joining the email list, and for your interest in these LUTs.
        Hopefully they're as useful to your production workflow as they are to
        mine.
    </p>

        Of course, this isn't the final version; I'll keep updating them as new
        HDR standards come out, so make sure you check back soon.
