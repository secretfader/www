Today we explore multi-disciplinism with [Randi Russo](http://randirusso.com), who paints, sketches, and also performs music. She has shared the stage with *Crosby, Stills and Nash*, *Regina Spektor*, and other notable performers. Her art was also recently spotlighted by Chicago's *Thomas Masters Gallery*. Together, we weigh options for multi-disciplined artists.

Of course, we also analyze the news &mdash; cutting thorough the unncessary hyperbole &mdash; and detail exactly what it means for you. It Spotify a good outlet for new music? Are Pandora's royalty rates fair to artists? We confront these questions head-on, and more.
