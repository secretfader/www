If you celebrate, this week is a time for friends, family, and thankfulness. Here at Dispatch, your hosts are grateful for many things, including your continued listenership and support. In this hour, we come to you from [Show of Hands Chicago](http://showofhandschicago.com) 2014, to ask a handful of artists what they're thankful for.

Many of the artisans we asked were thankful for their patrons. Maybe that includes you! We've included links to everyone featured for your perusal. As the holiday season draws nearer, please consider financially supporting them.
