Your album is a musical portfolio, and some artists prefer to release it into the world carefully. Others simply drop it, and depend on a tightly-knit fan-base to discover and spread the word.

In this episode of Dispatch, Joshua outlines three major album release case studies, and the perks or potential negatives to each method.

It's a careful balance. Too much teasing can burn out your audience, but too little can cause you to lose release-day excitement.

Which is the best method? Is one clearly better than the other? We answer these questions, and others.
