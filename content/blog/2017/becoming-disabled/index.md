This past week has been one of the most difficult on record. It began with
preparing an application for a position I hoped to fill, while navigating the
complexities of my expanding disability with a new potential employer.

By Thursday, I had fallen twice and hesitantly accepted the loan of a wheelchair
from Children's Hospital. We were there for an unexpected surgery on my
daughter, Sloan. I wanted nothing more than to be present for her in that
moment, and my disability came between us.

On Friday, I came to grips with the fact that I will likely need to purchase a
wheelchair of my own, just prior to being dismissed from the interview process.

My posts concerning daily life with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome have always breathed
a confessional aire, birthed as whispers before the dawn; a kind of pain-riddled
poetry attempting to explain why my body was degrading so rapidly. The issue now
is to describe the reality of slowly becoming disabled.

I don't know if I'm prepared for this task.

For those of you following my journey with genetic illness, [we
checked in last June](/life-on-the-inside-part-ii/) after our family relocated to
Colorado. "#DesertLife," as I've jokingly referred to it since the move, has
treated us well. Not everyone sees [snow-capped peaks from the nearby Rockies on
their morning
trek,](https://twitter.com/nicholaswyoung/status/840227336570179585) and I
cannot overstate how my life has been improved by safe access to medicine,
practically on-demand, by flashing my state-issued medical marijuana card.
Denver's tech scene is also rising nationally, adding to the reasons that I
should be here.

Despite what I hoped for, the days between then and now have not been the
kindest to my mind or body. Both are weak from the work of keeping my body
together, and the need to constantly reassert myself as a person.

In my articles last year, I discussed the decade-long process of obtaining my
diagnosis, the growing impact of chronic pain, general ineffectivenss of
opiates, and the path to becoming a medical cannabis patient. At the time, I was
still able to walk approximately a block or cycle several miles before the pain
became overpowering. Holding my lax hips and knees together long enough to board
transit wasn't the easiest task, but it didn't cause the pain I feel now.

It's quite common for EDS patients to either become symptomatic or experience a rapid
acceleration in symptoms late in their 20's. It was therefore altogether
unsurprising when, after years of vigorous exercise (for someone with a
connective tissue disorder), my joints were failing in rapid succession.

The first to go was my right knee, which was immediately followed by the ankle
below it. My issues with these joints began after a painful bicycle wreck, where
I flew over the handlebars while my lower extremities were tangled in the frame.
My rheumatologist at the time dismissed it after a few Xrays, and refused to
investigate further. Never one to quit, I recovered on my own and continued to
ride Chicago streets.

As the pain grew progressively worse, I started wearing knee
braces and limiting my walking. During September, I attended one Startup Week
event, but the walking required to attend others was prohibitive.

Even though I was in debilitating pain, I still tried to cover it up. My body
was still executing it's standard operating procedure, which is no doubt shared
by chronic illness patients around the globe: attempt to be normal until you no
longer can.

In December, I purchased a pair of forearm crutches on the recommendation of my
general practictioner. Since then, they've been a mostly helpful tool as I move
about. However, connective tissue is everywhere and so is the damage caused by
disorders that affect it. It wasn't long until I noticed additional pain in my
shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hands &mdash; all a product of lifting with my
upper body, something I struggled to accomplish even when feeling well.

In order to understand where I was emotionally and mentally during December, you
must first rewind to the wee hours of November 9th. Just as the early
morning light began to appear, I awoke, in pain, to the news that Donald Trump
had won the presidency in a [surprising upset victory](/history-in-the-making/)
and would likely be taking a radically conservative agenda with him to
Washington. The entire Trump campaign, start to finish, was built on scorched
earth techniques. His goal, like many Republican-leaning legislators before him,
was to loosen the chokehold on industry.

One of his signature policy items was repealing the Affordable Care Act (A.C.A,
"Obamacare"), the [law that granted me access to
healthcare](/life-on-the-inside-part-ii/) when the only option available to my
wife and I was purchasing insurance on the individual market.

As you might imagine, being born with a twisted spine is incredibly frustrating,
but just as I didn't expect to be diagnosed with an incurable genetic syndrome,
I also didn't assume I'd enter adulthood without the means of attaining basic
healthcare. Most of my visits were, for a time, denied due to one of my many
pre-existing conditions. This year, that desire to access quality health
services that allow me to contribute to society and ease chronic pain without
also carrying a disproportionate cost of the country's healthcare system has
become exceedingly political.

Before and after the election, I opened discusssions with a handul of friends on the
topic of healthcare. My conversational targets were strategic: some of them were
privy to intimate details of my illness and struggle, but all of whom voted
Republican or abstained. They blamed the A.C.A. for their skyrocketing
healthcare costs; I hoped to understand how they could lob criticism at a
patient. "Absolutely," I'm sure I said in response to the assertion that flaws
remain in the bill, but I could not concede that their rising insurance premiums
were a direct result of the bill's passage. (I believe the healthcare industry
is large and complex, and cannot be expressed with overly simplistic arguments,
such as this one.)

In every conversation, I lost a friend. Not one was able to think clearly about
anything other than the tax break they'd get if repeal passed. Considering the 
dread I've felt these past months, as the Republicans' replacement bill has
died repeatedly [only to be
resurrected](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-tom-macarthur-defends-health-care-vote-rancorous/story?id=47340119)
(and often with even crueler language), I can't find a morally just reason to stand by
their decision. I haven't heard a single apology, and I don't expect one. I hope they're happy.

Of course, there is plenty of [misinformation circulating in the wake of bill
passed by the
House](https://nypost.com/2017/05/09/no-the-health-bill-doesnt-gut-coverage-for-pre-existing-conditions/), and sadly, most of it has clear partisan intent.

I didn't sleep the night of February 22nd. It was my birthday, but I was
preparing for surgery the following morning. I was under strict orders to
not consume cannabis in the 24-hour period beforehand. If you know me, you
understand that was a very painful day. But, after emerging from surgery few
hours later, I felt positive about the whole experience, citing that my knee
felt "practically new."

The hope was that this would be the first of a few surgeries, each one a piece in my doctor's comprehensive strategy
to help me walk unassisted again. However, my orthopedic care team has decided
to be intentionally unhelpful, so I'm once again back to square one. My Physical
Therapists, the team who has arguably helped the most, loves to wear a new smug
look while informing me that they understand the pain better than I do.

In related news, I have a plan to record every interaction with a healthcare
provider from now on, and maintain a complete audio record to be accessed
whenever I find it necessary.

The realization earlier this week that I need a wheelchair admittedly has me
shaken, but it's also a reality I mentally prepared for. The unfortunate reality
is that while I can stand, I cannot walk without dislocating a joint or pinching
a nerve so significantly that I often topple to the ground, likely dislocating
other joints in the process.

I dread walking, the pain is so great. I'm afraid of the consequences of
repeated falls with a connective tissue disorder. Logically, for these reasons
and many, many others, I realize this is a necessary assistive device and yet,
I'm ashamed to need it before I turn 30.

In my professional life, explaining complex lessons has become a specialty.
Here, I don't have any answers. Maybe it'll be okay if I lean into work I love,
learn to be okay with the chaos of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
