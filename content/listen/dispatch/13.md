The world moves fast, and even the most culturally savvy individual can find themselves wondering if something is cool or not. [*Coolness Graphed*](http://coolnessgraphed.com), a new book from [Knock Knock](http://www.knockknockstuff.com), helps you navigate the world of what's cool, through a series of helpful graphs.

This week, Joshua and Nicholas are joined in-studio by author, copywriter, and renegade creative [RC Jones](https://twitter.com/likethecola), the man behind the book above, and the [*Slightly Insulting Chicago Posters*](http://slightlyinsultingchicagoposters.tumblr.com), which you may have seen online, or in Chicago area stores.

Both RC's posters and book began on Tumblr, where his posts were consumed by hundreds of fans daily. In Chicago, at least, his posters became a cultural touchstone, poking fun at each distinct neighborhood with snarky wit and gorgeous typography.
